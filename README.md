## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset consists of used car listings with various features such as fuel type, brand, model, transmission type, and condition. The data is divided into training and test sets, with the training set used for model training and the test set for final predictions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outlier detection.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming categorical variables using Label Encoding.
- **Data Standardization**: Scaling features for better model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Training a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict car prices.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Regression-of-Used-Car-Prices.git
   cd Regression-of-Used-Car-Prices
2. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Prepare your dataset and place it in the specified directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook (Used_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb) to execute the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction steps.
The final predictions will be saved in a CSV file for submission.
